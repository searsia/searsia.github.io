Translated to English, the cartoon says: “Searsia allows users to search sources that Google cannot use”.&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A search engine in your browser&quot;, &quot;url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/blog\/2017-04-21-search-engine-in-your-browser\/index.html&quot;, &quot;description&quot;:&quot;This is useful for the many smaller web sites that are out there: personal blogs, sites with software documentation, sites of small and medium-sized enterprises, and yes, the great Cranfield collection.&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Searsia - Protocol: Examples&quot;, &quot;url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/protocol.html#examples&quot;, &quot;description&quot;:&quot;While the Searsia resource configurations provide a way to get the search results for a great variety of existing search engines, Searsia also provides a flexible way to structure the search results from these engines.&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Three worries about web search engines: 1. The Search Engine Manipulation Effect&quot;, &quot;url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/blog/2017-01-13-isoc-three-worries/index.html#1-the-search-engine-manipulation-effect&quot;, &quot;description&quot;:&quot;In all cases, people changed their minds towards the biased search engine’s results much and much more often than you would expect if people change their minds at random. The study shows that people have a great trust in search engines.&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;A search engine in your browser: Conclusion&quot;, &quot;url&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/blog/2017-04-21-search-engine-in-your-browser/index.html#conclusion&quot;, &quot;description&quot;:&quot;In-browser search engines are feasible for small collections of up to a few thousand pages. They are easy to deploy and work on static web sites that do not handle any server-side processing. Their functionality is great from a privacy-perspective. Your browser downloads an inverted index or a static search result file, and it searches inside your own machine. The site that you are searching will not find out what you searched for. Please note, Searsia’s in-browser search is still experimental and largely undocumented. The implementation in the v1 branch on Github is much better than the master branch, and it will be further improved in the near future. We will provide more guidelines and documentation once we release version 1.0.0 of Searsia. In the meantime, contact us if you need help trying out Searsia’s in-browser search.&quot;}],&quot;resource&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;:&quot;searsia&quot;, &quot;mimetype&quot;:&quot;application\/searsia+json&quot;, &quot;favicon&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/images\/searsia.png&quot;, &quot;banner&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/images\/banner.png&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Searsia&quot;, &quot;rerank&quot;:&quot;lm&quot;, &quot;apitemplate&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/searsia\/search.json&quot;, &quot;usertemplate&quot;:&quot;http:\/\/searsia.org\/searsiaclient\/search.html?q={searchTerms}&quot;}, &quot;searsia&quot;:&quot;v1.0.0&quot;}">Weird but true</div>
