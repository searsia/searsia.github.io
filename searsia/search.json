      "description": "Today's web search engines need to combine search results from many independent sources, such as results from a Web crawl, from Advertisements, from Video's, Books, News, Shopping, etc. Searsia provides an approach to search that: Manages and shares large collections of independent sources. Selects for each query the most relevant sources. Combines sources in an aggregated search interface. Learns over time what kind of information each source provides. Searsia is free and open-source software, and demonstrated by UTwente Search , and Dr Sheet Music . UTwente Search is an enterprise search engine for the University of Twente that combines the results of more than 40 sources, including results from Google's web crawl, from Courses, from News, the Telephone directory, the Timetables, as well as results from social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. Dr. Sheet Music is a federated search engine dedicated to sheet music. It combines the results of more than 50 resources, including advertisements from affiliate programs like Amazon, eBay and ShareASale and advertisements for charities like CharityChoice and GoedeDoelen.nl.

      "title": "Searsia - Protocol",
      "url": "http:\/\/searsia.org\/protocol.html",
      "description": "The Searsia protocol is a RESTful interface. The calls follow the API templates introduced before , that take a query and output JSON search results with three fields: \"resource\" containing the resource definition; \"hits\" containing the search results, and \"searsia\" containing the version number. The resource definition tells Searsia how to get search results from an external source. Searsia copies resource definitions from other Searsia search engines, or from files from the local file system. This page explains how to configure Searsia by creating search engine definition files. Searsia can add search engines that follow Searsia's JSON format, as well as several other formats, including HTML. We will start by adding the main engine by making a file index.json . The minimum information needed to add a search engine are: The engine's definition (called \"resource\" ), which needs the engine's identifier ( \"id\" ) that should match the file name, hence: \"index\" (excluding the file name extension). The Searsia version number ( \"searsia\" ), which will be v1.0.0 . An API template ( \"apitemplate\" ) for getting the search results, or alternatively, the search results themselves, called \"hits\" . In this case, we add three hits containing each only an engine identifier (called \"rid\" for \"resource identifier\"): \"engine1\" , \"engine2\" , and \"engine3\" The file index.json contains: { \"resource\": { \"id\": \"index\", \"name\": \"My Engine\" }, \"searsia\": \"v1.0.0\", \"hits\": [ { \"rid\": \"engine1\" }, { \"rid\": \"engine2\" }, { \"rid\": \"engine3\" } ] } We can test our engine definition index.json as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m index.json -t json which gives the following output: Searsia server v1.0.2 Testing: index (My Engine) {\"hits\": [ {\"rid\": \"engine1\"}, {\"rid\": \"engine2\"}, {\"rid\": \"engine3\"} ]} Warning: less than 10 results for query: searsia; see \"testquery\" or \"rerank\". Test succeeded. So, our test succeeded. Instead of testing the JSON output of a single engine, we might also test all engines in the federated search engine as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m index.json -t all which results in 3 errors, because we have not yet added the engines engine1 , engine2 and engine3 . Searsia server v1.0.2 Testing: index (My Engine) Warning: less than 10 results for query: searsia; see \"testquery\" or \"rerank\". Testing: engine1 Test failed: FileNotFoundException: engine1.json (No such file or directory) Testing: engine2 Test failed: FileNotFoundException: engine2.json (No such file or directory) Testing: engine3 Test failed: FileNotFoundException: engine3.json (No such file or directory) ERROR: Test failed: 3 engines failed. Let's add some more example engines below. To add an external Searsia resource (an engine that implements the Searsia protocol, returning results of mime-type application\/searsia+json ), add the engines API template to the resource definition. The file engine1.json contains: { \"resource\": { \"id\": \"engine1\", \"name\": \"Sheet Music\", \"favicon\": \"https:\/\/drsheetmusic.com\/images\/drsheetmusic-note.png\", \"apitemplate\": \"https:\/\/drsheetmusic.com\/searsia\/index.json?q={searchTerms?}&page={startPage?}\" }, \"searsia\": \"v1.0.0\", } The search engine definition may again be tested with: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m engine1.json -t json Searsia can provide search results by scraping the HTML that search engines return for their end users. To add an HTML resource, use text\/html in the field \"mimetype\" . As the field \"apitemplate\" , take the resource's URL from your browser after querying the search engine, replacing the query in the url by {searchTerms} . If the URL does not contain a query, the search engine probably uses a POST request . To find out what the POST request is, we recommend Live HTTP Headers for Firefox. Put the POST string, replacing the query by {searchTerms} in the field \"post\" . For a JSON post request, additionally use \"postencode\" : \"application\/json\" Searsia uses XPath 1.0 to extract the search results from the web..."

To use the web client: Set the variable API_TEMPLATE in the second line of the file js\/searsia.js ; Open index.html in a web browser; Congratulations! You now run your own web application for federated search. The API template is a url with a placeholder for the query and possibly other parameters. Examples of API templates of on-line Searsia servers are the University of Twente's site search engine, and Dr. Sheet Music: https:\/\/search.utwente.nl\/searsia\/index.json?q={searchTerms}&page={startPage?} or https:\/\/drsheetmusic.com\/searsia\/index.json?q={searchTerms}&page={startPage?} If you run Searsia Server on your local machine (see next section), you can connect the client to your own server by setting the API template to something like: http:\/\/localhost:16842\/searsia\/index?q={searchTerms?}&page={startPage?} Download the Java server searsiaserver.jar and use the following command to start the server: java -jar searsiaserver.jar The server requires Java 8 or higher. Just like the web client, the java server needs another Searsia server's API template to connect to. We call the other server the mother , because your server will learn what it needs to know from the other server. Your server will display the following message: Please provide mother's api template (use '-m'). Additionally, the server displays all server options . Use the option -m to provide the API template, for instance one of the example templates under Client Options above. Your Searsia server copies the Searsia search engine definitions of the server it connects to (specified by the API template). Your server will have its own API template, which it will display at start up. For instance, connect to Dr. Sheet Music as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m 'https:\/\/drsheetmusic.com\/searsia\/index.json?q={searchTerms}&page={startPage?}' Searsia server v1.0.2 Starting: Dr. Sheet Music (index) API template: http:\/\/localhost:16842\/searsia\/index?q={searchTerms}&page={startPage?} Use Ctrl+c to stop. Use the reported API template in your client as explained above to connect your client to your server. A Searsia server provides access to many search engines. Together, the search engines form a federation. Like a federation of countries that form a country together, Searsia manages a federation of search engines that form a search engine together. Each search engine in the federation has a unique identifier. The identifier of the search engine in the examples above is ' index '. Suppose there is another search engine in the federation that is called ' didyoumean ', then we can access it by replacing ' index ' by ' didyoumean ' as follows: https:\/\/search.utwente.nl\/searsia\/didyoumean If you look at the URL in your browser, you will see the JSON search engine definition below: { \"resource\": { \"apitemplate\": \"https:\/\/search.utwente.nl\/searsia\/didyoumean.php?q={searchTerms}\", \"favicon\": \"https:\/\/search.utwente.nl\/ut-icons\/ut.png\", \"id\": \"didyoumean\", \"mimetype\": \"application\/searsia+json\", \"name\": \"Did you mean:\", \"testquery\": \"test\" }, \"searsia\": \"v1.0.2\" } Searsia servers copy and share these search engine definition files. We might now start a local Searsia server that serves search results from ' didyoumean ' as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m 'https:\/\/search.utwente.nl\/searsia\/didyoumean?q={searchTerms}' Searsia retrieves the definition file and runs a local copy that provides results from ' didyoumean '. In fact, we might also download the JSON definition file to our machine and then start Searsia Server from there with the same effect: wget https:\/\/search.utwente.nl\/searsia\/didyoumean.json java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m didyoumean.json Searsia Server tests a search engine using the -t option as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m didyoumean.json -t json This will output the json search results for the..."

      "description": "Posted on November 6, 2016 We are happy and proud to announce that the Vietsch Foundation will support the further development of Searsia. The Vietsch Foundation was founded by Willem Karel Vietsch (1952-2014) through his last will and testament: Karel was very involved in the Internet community. He spent a large part of his life working in the area of research and education networking, which he help developing with his energy, creativity and thorough methodical approach. Sadly, his early death, put a stop to Karel’s mission to support people and new developments, therefore he created the Vietsch Foundation, with the official objective of promoting “research into and development of advanced technology for scientific research and higher education”, in the widest sense. Searsia is funded from the “Research and Higher Education Technology Fund”, a new thematic fund that is managed by the NLnet Foundation . The Vietsch Foundation will fund the Searsia work packages: Recommendations and Advertisements . Searsia manages large collections of independent sources. Many advanced features of search engines might be seen as sources too, such as query autocompletion, related queries, and spelling correction, that is, these features are provided by modules that receive the query, and return a recommendation. Query autocompletion provides users with suggested queries in a drop down box as they type their query. Related queries are given on the search page to direct users to alternative formulations of their query, or to otherwise related information. Spelling correction suggests corrected queries if the user types an incorrectly spelled query, or an otherwise unusual query. Corrections are either used directly or presented to the user as alternatives (“Did you mean: …”). There are two main approaches to recommendations, often used in for instance movie recommender systems: 1) collaborative filtering provides recommendations based on actions from similar users (as in Amazon: “Customers who bought this item also bought…”); and 2) content-based filtering provides recommendations based on the similarity between items. Autocompletions and related queries in search engines are almost always based on queries from other users, i.e., they are essentially collaborative filtering approaches. Besides the fact that it might be undesirable to log the actions of the users, there are also other drawbacks: First, there is a cold-start problem: How to implement recommendations for a new system (when there are no user actions yet), or for a system that does not have a lot of users? Second, user queries might be stupid, racist, or otherwise objectionable: How to prevent recommending those? (it is not hard to find examples on-line of search engine autocomplete fails, as well as law suits about objectionable recommendations). We will implement and demonstrate open source solutions for recommended queries that use content-based filtering, for instance based on a web crawl, or directly based on the Searsia sample index (The Searsia server indexes search results for each resource to learn what information each resource provides). Our recommendations work without user tracking. Advertisements are the main source of income for many web sites and search engines. To make Searsia an interesting solution for developers of web search applications, we want to provide them the means to easily and transparantly add advertisements as an independent source to Searsia. The advertisements must be recognisable as advertisements, they should not track the users of the search service, and it should be easy to switch them off. Advertisements in search engines are much more effective than advertisements on ordinary web sites, because users tell the search engine exactly what they are currently looking for: The user’s query is the ideal signal for an advertisement network. We believe user tracking is not desirable and not needed for good advertisements in..."

      "url": "http:\/\/searsia.org\/blog\/2017-01-13-isoc-three-worries\/index.html",
      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on January 13, 2017 This post contains the text of the lightning talk presented at the New Year Event of the Dutch Internet Society (ISOC) on 12 January 2017. Of course, the slides for the Internet Society meeting were appropriately made in HTML. Web search is the single most important application of the web. Without search, the web would be virtually useless. I love Google (and Yahoo, and Bing), but there are some things that worry me about search engines. Let’s discuss three of those worries: Search engines influence people. In 2014, Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in the US conducted the following experiment: They asked people what candidate they would support in the Australian election, Tony Abbott or Julia Gillard? Then they let them search information about the candidates. However, the researchers did not tell the people that they manipulated the search results. People used a search engine for which higher-ranked search results linked to Web pages that describe one candidate as the better than the other. Their paper shows the results of two search engines: one that is biased to Gillard and one that is biased to Abbot. In all cases, people changed their minds towards the biased search engine’s results much and much more often than you would expect if people change their minds at random. The study shows that people have a great trust in search engines. If results are willingly manipulated, search engines could easily swing an election. The researchers call this the Search Engine Manipulation Effect . The second thing that worries me: Search engines receive information from us that is really, really private. We search things about our health, about our sexual preferences, about our financial situation. Most search engines log our queries, and they hold on to that information, indefinitely. They also log our clicks. And they use this information to target us with advertisements. Sadly, the most vulnerable people in our society, people with bad health or with bad credit scores, are in practice targeted the most. It is worth reading Cathy O’Neil’s analogy between optimizing advertisement returns and the “itinerant quack” in an old western ( O’Neil 2016 ): Vulnerability is worth gold. It always has been. Picture an itinerant quack in an old western movie. He pulls into town with his wagon full of jangling jars and bottles. When he sits down with an elderly prospective customer, he seeks out her weaknesses. She covers her mouth when she smiles, indicating that she’s sensitive about her bad teeth. She anxiously twirls her old wedding ring, which from the looks of her swollen knuckle will be stuck there till the end of her days. Arthritis. So when he pitches his products to her, he focuses on the ugliness of her teeth and her aching hands. He can promise to restore the beauty of her smile and wash away the pain from her joints. With this knowledge, he knows he’s halfway to a sale before even clearing his throat to speak. The third thing that worries me: Search engines need a lot of resources. They constantly crawl the web, downloading pages to check if things changed. My personal blog at the university is downloaded more by web robots that crawl the site, than by people that read my blog posts… You might think: Write better blog posts, Djoerd, and you are right. But, even so, constantly downloading my blog to detect changes is crazy. My blog has its own search field, which instantly shows updates when something changes. If only, somehow, we can redirect queries from search engines, that show an interest in the things I blog about, directly to my blog’s search field? Searsia’s approach to search can ease some of these worries. Searsia is a federated search engine. A Searsia search engine is a federation of search engines, like the European Union (EU) is a federation of countries. Within the EU, each countries has..."

      "title": "Query autocompletions considered harmful",
      "url": "http:\/\/searsia.org\/blog\/2017-02-09-autocomplete\/index.html",
      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on February 9, 2017 Search engines suggest completions of partially typed queries to help users speed up their searches, for instance by showing the suggested completions in a drop down box. These query autocompletions enable the user to search faster, searching for long queries with relatively few key strokes. Jakobsson (1986) showed that for a library information system, users are able to identify items using as little as 4.3 characters on average. Query autocompletions are now widely used, either with a drop down box or as instant results (Bast and Weber 2006) . While Jakobsson (1986) used the titles of documents as completions of user queries, web search engines today generally use large logs of queries submitted previously by their users. Using previous queries seems a common-sense choice: The best way to predict a query? Use previous queries! Several scientific studies use the AOL query log provided by Pass et al. (2006) to show that query autocompletion algorithms using query logs are effective (Bar-Yossef and Kraus 2011 ; Shokouhi and Radinsky 2012 ; Whiting and Jose 2014 ; Mitra and Craswell 2015 ; Cai et al. 2016) . However, query autocompletion algorithms that are based on query logs are problematic in two important ways: 1) They return offensive and damaging results; 2) They suffer from a destructive feedback loop. Let’s discuss these two problems in the following sections. Query autocompletion based on actual user queries may return offensive results. In 2010, a French appeals court ordered Google to remove the word arnaque, which translates roughly as “scam”, from appearing in Google’s autocompletions for CNFDI, the Centre National Privé de Formation a Distance (McGee 2010) . Google’s defense argued that its tool is based on an algorithm applied to actual search queries: It was users that searched for “cnfdi arnaque” that caused the algorithm to select offensive suggestions. The court however ruled that Google is responsible for the suggestions that it generates. Google lost a similar lawsuit in Italy, where queries for an unnamed plaintiff’s name were presented with autocomplete suggestions including truffatore (“con man”) and truffa (“fraud”) (Meyer 2011) . In another similar law suite, German’s former first lady Bettina Wulff” sued Google for defamation when queries for her name completed with terms like “escort” and “prostitute” (Lardinois 2012) . In yet another lawsuit in Japan, Google was ordered to disable autocomplete results for an unidentified man who could not find a job because a search for his name linked him with crimes he was not involved with (BBC 2012) . Google has since updated its autocompletion results by filtering offensive completions for person names, no matter who the person is (Yehoshua 2016) . But controversies over query autocompletions remain. A study by Baker and Potts (2013) highlights that autocompletions produce suggested terms which can be viewed as racist, sexist or homophobic. Baker and Pots analyzed the results of over 2,500 query prefixes and concluded that completion algorithms inadvertently help to perpetuate negative stereotypes of certain identity groups. There is increasing evidence that autocompletions play an important role in spreading fake news and propaganda. Query suggestions actively direct users to fake content on the web, even when they are not looking for it (Roberts 2016) . Examples include bizarre completions for – again – person names, like “Michelle Obama is a man”, but also completions like “Did the holocaust happen”, which if selected, returns as its top result a link to the neo-Nazi site stormfront.org (Cadwalladr 2016) . The examples show that query autocompletions can be harmful when they are based on searches by previous users. Harmful completions are suggested when ordinary users seek to expose or confirm rumors and conspiracy theories. Furthermore, there are indications that..."

      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on March 18, 2017 Today, we launch searsiasuggest , a simple but effective open source solution for query suggestions. It implements 3 kinds of query suggestions: 1) autocompletions, 2) spelling correction, and 3) related queries. The software works pretty much like many similar solutions: It inputs a list of queries with their popularity, it indexes those queries, and it ranks the queries given the user input. The query suggestions are demonstrated on UT Search , an enterprise search engine for the University of Twente. Let’s have a look at the three kinds of query suggestions implemented by searsiasuggest : Query autocompletions return popular queries by treating the user input as a prefix. For instance, when the user inputs “computer s”, the system returns popular completions of that prefix, such as “computer science”, “computer systems” and “computer supported cooperative work”. Spelling correction will suggest alternative spellings for user queries. If for instance the user ignores the suggestions from autocompletions and enters “computer sience” instead (without the “c” in “science”) then the spelling correction kicks in, returning “computer science” as its suggested query. UT search displays the following: Suppose the user now selects the corrected query “computer science”, then the search engine might show related queries, such as “Electrical Engineering Mathematics and Computer Science” and “science and technology” as follows. No rocket science either, you have probably seen this before in web search. UT search shows: To use searsiasuggest , you need a list of popular query suggestions. How to obtain those suggestions? In practice, search engines often use queries from previous users, i.e. query logs, to return query suggestions. Query logs are very effective in predicting query autocompletions and related queries. If you have a query log for your search engine, then you can effectively use them in searsiasuggest . However, there are many downsides to using query logs. We talked about some of these in last month’s blog post Query autocompletions considered harmful : Query suggestions that use query logs may return offensive and damaging results, and they suffer from a destructive feedback loop, where bad suggestions are mutually reinforced by the search engine and its users. Other downsides might be of a more principled nature: Maybe your organization’s privacy policies do not allow you to log user input and user interactions; or maybe We don’t track you is your organization’s motto and main strategy to distinguish your product from its competitors. Inspired by research of Sumit Bhatia, Debapriyo Majumdar, and Prasenjit Mitra , Reiner Kraft and Jason Zien , and Van Dang and Bruce Croft , we decided to obtain our query suggestions from the anchor text of web pages, i.e., the text that you click on in hyperlinks. We collected more than 1 million web pages for the domain utwente.nl and extracted about 200,000 unique query suggestions from the anchor text of those web pages. UT Search receives currently about 1000 queries per day on average (including repeats), so collecting that many unique queries from user logs will likely take several years. We described the procedure in: Collecting Data for Query Suggestions: a poor person’s approach . Are query suggestions from anchor text any good compared to query suggestions from query logs? To check this, we used the query log of Greg Pass, Abdur Chowdhury, and Cayley Torgeson , which contains 20 million queries submitted by about 650,000 users to the AOL search engine between March and May in 2006. Following the recent query autocompletion experiments by Fei Cai, Shangsong Liang, and Maarten de Rijke , we used queries submitted before 8 May 2006 as train queries and queries submitted afterwards as test queries. We removed queries containing URL substrings ( http: , https: , www. , .com , .net ,..."

      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on April 21, 2017 Information Retrieval has come a long way since Cyril Cleverdon conducted his famous Cranfield experiments on 1400 paper abstracts in the 1960’s. At the time, searching the massive 1.6 megabyte Cranfield collection was a big deal. Today, we routinely take pictures that are much bigger, and even a crappy smart phone can search the data in milliseconds in the web browser. Seriously! Here’s a screen shot of the Oukitel OriginalOne (a smart phone that has 512 MB RAM and costs about € 50) searching the Cranfield collection in its Android 4.4.2 default browser. It’s the phone that does the actual searching: Searching Cranfield on your phone Search engines use inverted files to quickly search in lots of documents. An inverted file operates much like the index in the back of a book that lists for each important term the pages that describe the term. Similarly, an inverted file lists for every word the web pages that contain the word. This allows a search engine to quickly select the pages for your query. A full-fledged inverted file search engine for the browser is provided by Sphinx , the Python Documentation Generator. While generating the documentation, Sphinx also generates a JavaScript file called searchindex.js which contains the inverted file. Before searching the documentation, the file is downloaded to the browser to provide search results in only milliseconds. A similar approach is taken by Lunr.js . Lunr is completely written in JavaScript. It provides indexing functionality, a powerful query language, and it runs both in the browser as server-side with node.js. Lunr’s standard mode of operation builds the entire index in the browser, but it also offers a way for downloading pre-built indexes similar to Sphinx. Another remarkable example of an inverted file search engine for the browser is JScene , a proof-of-concept search engine developed by Jimmy Lin. Lin (2015) pushed JScene to its limits by searching 1.1 million tweets in milliseconds on a Mac-book Pro (containing an i7 processor and 16 GB of RAM). Although awesome from a technical perspective, searching that many documents is not yet practical. JScene took more than 10 hours to create a massive 1.8 gigabyte index from 140 megabytes of tweets. The pre-built index would need to be downloaded to the browser before the querying can start (and most certainly would crash our crappy smart phone). So, while searching millions of pages might not be practical yet in the web browser, searching less than a few thousand pages certainly is. This is useful for the many smaller web sites that are out there: personal blogs, sites with software documentation, sites of small and medium-sized enterprises, and yes, the great Cranfield collection. Searsia is all about delegating search to other search engines. So why would Searsia support in-browser search? The reason is that in practice, the search quality of some engines in a federated search engine might not be that good. In such cases, Searsia provides the possibility to add the “rerank” attribute to a search engine definition, indicating that Searsia should rerank the results returned by the search engine. This works particularly well if the low-quality search engine provides a large result set, for instance the top 500 most recent news events. Reranking might be done server-side (by searsiaserver ) or in the browser (by searsiaclient ). In both cases, building an inverted index is useless, because the low quality search engine might provide different low quality results for each query. Instead, Searsia simply scans over each result to output a reranked top X of high quality search results to the user. Constructing the inverted file would be much more costly: In addition to scanning each document it has to do a complete sort of all term-document pairs. As an interesting side-effect of Searsia’s in-browser linear search approach, users can create a static Searsia search..."

      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on May 26, 2017 In many respects, advertisements drive the web. The biggest web companies today — yes, Google and Facebook — get most of their revenue from advertisements, but also many small web sites can exist because of advertising. So, as we work at Searsia to provide developers with open source tools to build beautiful search engines, we also want to provide them with easy ways to include advertisements alongside the search results. For, why would people make beautiful search engines if it only costs them? If you plan to put advertisements along-side your search results, then the terminology used in online advertising can be confusing. The Wikipedia page on on-line advertising distinguishes advertisers that buy advertisement space and publishers that sell advertisement space. Obviously, if you are building a search engine that displays ads, then you are a publisher — even though a search engine merely directs users to the real publishers. As a publisher\/seller you will interact with advertisers\/buyers through an advertising network , a company that connects advertisers to publishers. Online advertising is highly automated on platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of advertisement space. Such platforms, often called ad exchanges , serve multiple ad networks. Platforms are increasingly specializing towards either buying ad space or selling ad space, in which case they are called demand-side platforms or supply-side platforms . Platforms determine the prices of the advertisement space through bidding : Advertisers bid on advertisement space by deciding what they are willing to pay for each impression of their ad or for each click on their ad. This bidding process within an ad exchange can be very dynamic. In real-time bidding , advertising space is bought and sold on a per-impression basis. Real-time bidding sounds fascinating, but it is really a search: The platform searches the best advertisement based on various pieces of data, such as the user’s demographic information, browsing history, and location. The more accurate the behavioral targeting of users, the more the advertisement network earns. That’s why networks track users online. They profile users by “following” them around to gather as much data on users as possible. This way, when a user reads an article on a publisher’s web site, say a real publisher like a newspaper, the advertisement network can guess what advertisement the user is willing to click, and ultimately what product a user is willing to buy. Real-time bidding for search engines is much easier than real-time bidding for a newspaper site: Users of search engines tell the search engine explicitly what they are willing to click on. What would be a good ad for the query “car”? Right, an ad for the Tesla Model 3, for instance! There is absolutely no real need to track users for search ads. DuckDuckGo describes this aptly on the DuckDuckGo company pages : It is a myth that search engines need to track you to make money on Web search. When you type in a search, we can show an ad just based on that search term. For example, if you type in, “car” we show a car ad. That doesn’t involve tracking because it is based on the keyword and not the person. Interestingly, there is an open standard for real time bidding called OpenRTB . OpenRTB was launched in late 2010 by six companies in online advertising, representing both demand-side and supply-side platforms. The standard is actively maintained by the Interactive Advertising Bureau ( IAB ), and its latest version, OpenRTB version 2.5 , was released in December 2016. Many advertisement platforms support OpenRTB, usually version 2.3, which is currently the most widely adopted release. Examples are SSPHWY , DataXu , OpenX , BrightRoll (by Yahoo), DoubleClick (by Google), and RythmOne that claimed last week that it provides the first IAB certified implementation of OpenRTB.

      "description": "Posted on July 6, 2017 There’s a new search engine in town: Dr. Sheet Music is a search engine dedicated solely to sheet music. It retrieves results from more than 50 sites that provide sheet music; both sites that provide copyright-free sheets as sites from which you can buy sheet music of the latest popular songs. Give it a try at: https:\/\/drsheetmusic.com . Dr. Sheet Music does not build a huge index of all sheet music before-hand, as other search engines do. In fact, it never downloads a web page at all. Instead, when you search, it sends your query directly to the most promising sites. This way, you always get the latest results. Dr. Sheet Music will occasionally show advertisements for charities from CharityChoice and GoedeDoelen , see for instance the result for the query for Wagner’s Prelude to Act 3 of Lohengrin . In the near future, Dr. Sheet Music will show advertisements from on-line advertisers that provide native ads too, see also our thoughts on search advertising .

      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on October 2, 2017 What does “federated” mean in federated search? Like the European Union is a federation of independent countries, so is a Searsia engine a federation of independent search engines. When Searsia receives a query, it does not perform a lot of searching itself: Searsia forwards the query to a limited number of search engines in the federation that will do the actual searching. This has some interesting implications for the user’s privacy. An important implication is the following: Searsia does not forward any identifying information to the engines in the federation. Like many web applications, Searsia consists of a web client that runs in the user’s web browser and a server that runs on another system. Searsia forwards its queries via the server. The Searsia server will not forward any identifying information, such as cookies or the user agent string to engines in the federation. Also, by forwarding the query, the engines in the federation do not receive the user’s IP address . So, engines in the federation cannot track the queries of individual users, and engines will be unable to return personalized results or targeted advertisements. However, there are several ways that private information can still leak to search engines in the federation. We address three types of privacy leakage in this post: Leakage via images, via advertisements, and via clicks. Search engines in the federation might return thumbnail images in their search results. These images are not provided directly, but by means of the URL of the image. When the Searsia client retrieves the image to display it in the search results, it will send the privacy sensitive information mentioned above (cookies, user-agent string, IP number) to a third party site. The third party site can be the search engine in the federation that provided the image URL, or any other other site for that matter. Directly downloading images has another downsite: These images might only be available over an insecure connection (HTTP instead of HTTPS), thereby creating a mixed-content page, where part of the page is not secure. Although web browsers like Firefox will still display images in mixed-content pages, they also display a warning icon in the address bar. Whenever the user visits a web site, for instance by clicking on a search result, the user will obviously share some identifying information with that site. In some cases, this information might include the user’s search terms: Search leakage is the “transmission of a user’s search terms to the site in the search results that the user chooses to visit”. Leakage of the user’s search terms may occur because of the HTTP referrer header. Browsers that run the Searsia client will send this referrer header — possibly including the query — to the site that the user wants to visit. Leakage of the user’s search terms might be the biggest threat to privacy in this list, because users share intimate details with search engines. Users might search information about their health, about their sexual preferences, or about their financial situation. It is therefore important to annonymize queries properly. At Searsia we are investigating how to add advertisements to our search results without leaking information. Most on-line advertisement networks will instruct publishers that want to display advertisements to include Javascript in their page or they instruct publishers to load an external Javascript file (or both). Obviously in such cases, not only downloading the Javascript file leaks privacy information, but it additionally runs third-party code in the user’s browser to further monitor the user’s behaviour. For instance, advertising networks use web beacons to check if the advertisement is viewable or mouse Tracking to check if they are hovered or clicked. As an example of the requirements of advertisement networks, Yahoo’s Native ads for the web shows the kind of code..."

      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on November 8, 2017 Internet advertising is a completely messed-up, multi-trillion euro business that is controlled by a few big players, most notably Google and Facebook. Their business models are based on figuring out as much information about people as possible, and then using people’s weaknesses and vulnerabilities to persuade them to click on advertisements. A dystopia to make people click The worrying implications of these companies’ persuasion architectures are wonderfully described by Zeynep Tufekci’s TED talk: We are building a dystopia just to make people click on ads , in which she shows how companies like Facebook and Google manipulate people in hidden, subtle and unexpected ways. She also describes in detail how their advertising programs can be used not only to sell shoes, but also to swing elections and gain political influence. Trackers are really everywhere In case you are wondering whether Tufekci overreacts, have a look at the number of trackers that Steven Englehardt and Arvind Narayanan found in one million popular web sites . Their study finds Google Analytics on 75% of the web sites. Even more worrying is that all of the top 5 third party trackers, and even 12 of the top 20 trackers, are owned by Google. Facebook and Twitter, while not as ubiquitously present as Google, still have trackers on more than 10% of sites they crawl. So, Google is not only tracking what you search for and click on, they are also tracking other websites you visit, despite the fact that many users tell Google explicitly: Do Not Track . Google follows your online activities on millions of sites and stores your data indefinitely. That data can be subpoenaed by lawyers, even for civil cases like divorce. Google answered over 100,000 such requests last year. Google’s AdSense and other advertisement programs Using Google’s AdSense program is tempting, because it is effective: Google really does manage to make people click on advertisements. But if you run a Searsia search engine like Dr. Sheet Music , then using AdSense is not an attractive option for several reasons: Google bans search competitors by requiring original content created from scratch , which a search engine typically does not provide. Google does not allow the use of other third party advertisements , limiting your search engine to get its advertisements from Google only. (Remember that Searsia is a federated search engine that is designed to receive results from multiple sources.) Google will approve an AdSense application faster if the site uses Google Analytics , which as we saw, is the tracking software that is available on 75% of the web sites already. AdSense does not give the site control over the advertisements that are displayed: AdSense shows whatever advertisement Google deems appropriate. Also, your site has to allow third party cookies to be set, that is, cookies from a site other than your own site. At this point we may conclude that advertisement programs like Google’s AdSense are both unethical and unsuited for sites that run a Searsia search engine. So, does this prevent people that build a search engine with Searsia from monetizing their sites? We don’t think so. There is an alternative to the surveillance advertising model of Google that is often overlooked: the so-called affiliate marketing . Affiliate marketing Affiliate marketing is a type of on-line marketing where an affiliate (also called the publisher ) is paid a commission for each sale that is closed based on a link or advertisement on the affiliate’s web site. Running an affiliate program is often as easy as putting a hyperlink to a merchant’s product on your site that contains your affiliate identifier . When a visitor of your site clicks that link, the merchant (or affiliate network) will know from this identifier that the visitor originated from your site. If this user purchases the product (or any other product) on the site within a certain..."

      "description": "by Djoerd Hiemstra Posted on November 30, 2017 The past months Searsia investigated ways for small search engines to provide search advertisements without participating in the large advertisement networks of Google and Facebook, and more importantly, without the need for small search engines to track their users. Large advertisement networks operate by pay-per-impression or pay-per-click schemes that need third-party tracking bugs and third-party cookies to track users, even if they are not actively engaging with the advertisements. Large advertisement networks try to track their user also outside their own web sites by running code on other sites, such as like buttons (Facebook) and analytics code (Google). Tracking users is needed to provide targeted advertisements, but it is also needed to combat click fraud . Our solution provides sites that run their own search engine the means to include advertisements without the need to track their users with third-party trackers. In our previous blog post, we argued that affiliate marketing can serve as an alternative to tracking-based advertisements. Affiliate marketing is a type of on-line marketing where an affiliate (also called the publisher) is paid a commission for each sale that is closed based on a link or advertisement on the affiliate’s web site. Running an affiliate program is often as easy as putting a hyperlink to a merchant’s product on your site that contains your affiliate identifier. Because we run our affiliate advertisements in a search engine, we will still show targeted advertisements. If the user types “car”, we show a car advertisement. The ad is based on the keyword, not on the person, so it does not involve tracking. In what follows, we show the configuration files for 5 search advertisement programs. The examples use: 1) affiliate programs of multinational corporations like Amazon, 2) affiliate networks like ShareASale, and 3) any other information that we would like to advertise. Our configuration files are based on Searsia Server version 1.0 , which is not released yet, but already available on Github. The affiliate programs described here are demonstrated by Dr. Sheet Music , a federated search engine for sheet music. Affiliate programs: Amazon and eBay Many large sites run their own affiliate programs. Let’s have a look at two of the biggest players in affiliate land: Amazon and eBay. Amazon Affiliate Program Amazon’s affiliate program can be joined for free. Publishers earn up to 10% advertising fees with Amazon and its trusted merchants. Like many of the bigger affiliate programs, Amazon provides an Product Advertising API that can be found under “Tools” once you are logged in. The API can be configured as a Searsia engine with the following configuration file (which runs on-line here ). { \"resource\" : { \"id\" : \"amazon\" , \"name\" : \"Amazon\" , \"favicon\" : \"https:\/\/amazon.com\/favicon.ico\" , \"apitemplate\" : \"http:\/\/webservices.amazon.com\/onca\/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemSearch&AWSAccessKeyId={accesskey}&AssociateTag={associateid}&SearchIndex=Music&Keywords={q}\" , \"testquery\" : \"verdi\" , \"mimetype\" : \"application\/xml\" , \"signature\" : \"HmacSHA256({secretkey})\" , \"itempath\" : \"\/\/Items\/Item\" , \"extractors\" : { \"title\" : \".\/ItemAttributes\/Title\" , \"description\" : \".\/ItemAttributes\/Artist|.\/ItemAttributes\/Manufacturer|.\/ItemAttributes\/Creator\" , \"tags\" : \"'advertisement'\" , \"url\" : \".\/DetailPageURL\" }, \"privateparameters\" : { \"associateid\" : \"VALUE MISSING\" , \"accesskey\" : \"VALUE MISSING\" , \"secretkey\" : \"VALUE MISSING\" } }, \"searsia\" : \"v1.0.0\" } To use this configuration file, get your Associate Id, Access Key and Secret Key from Amazon’s affiliate program and fill them in under \"privateparameters\" .

The changes implemented in Searsia Version 1.0 were inspired by the need to support recommendations and advertisements without tracking the users of search engines. Release notes The most important changes with the previous version, Version 0.4, are: A server can now be configured using simple JSON files, either locally or remotely on – for instance – Github; This breaks compatibility with earlier versions of Searsia; API templates now follow the OpenSearch URL template syntax ; Old templates are still supported, but give a “deprecated” warning; Resources can be easily removed again from the federation; Engines can be tested by Searsia Server, outputting JSON or intermediate XML results for debugging purposes. There is also an option to test each resource in the federation; The server provides health statistics for each resource with the following information: time when the resource was started, time of last update, time of last successful query, time of last error, number of successful queries, number of errors, and the last error message; Results are provided from the server cache if a resource is used twice with the same query in a short period of time; The server’s resource selection ranking now supports paging (not yet supported by the client); There is an option to sign API requests with a private key (with one implementation: Amazon’s affiliate program API); Both the server and the client support linear search\/reranking of search results. The client’s in browser search is used for Searsia Site Search and by NLNet search ; The server’s linear search is used by for instance ShareASale’s affiliate program ; The client supports query autocompletions, as well as advertisements in a separate column; The client provides improved privacy by instructing the browser not to leak the query string in the HTTP referrer header, and by an option for proxying of search result images; The server supports more API’s and types of search engines, including results from various affiliate advertising programs; Please read information on how to get started with Searsia on Searsia’s Start page. We hope Searsia Version 1.0 will make it a lot easier for developers to run their own federated search engine.

      "description": "Posted on January 19, 2018 This post is based on the Searsia lightning talk for the 2018 New Year meeting of the Dutch Internet Society , for which the slides were appropriately made in HTML. (top picture by @bitsoffreedom@twitter.com ) The following poem, which according to the poet, @lifning@cybre.space , has been “floating around the fediverse”, perfectly describes what’s wrong with the world wide web today: roses are red violets are blue in surveillance capitalism a poem reads you and shows you ads for flower shops and tracks your clicks and never stops it cares not about if privacy's harmed the money is green when people are farmed twitter is cyan facebook is blue your friends are the product and so are you In surveillance capitalism , companies compete by collecting as much data as possible through surveillance. They sell that data, or they use the data to predict who is most likely to buy a product or service. Why do companies use surveillance? They will (have to) explain this in their terms-of-service: You know, the lengthy disclaimer that you accepted without reading. Typically, the terms-of-service of companies like Google and Facebook claim that collecting user data is necessary for at least two reasons: 1) to improve the service and 2) to show targeted advertisements . An example of a search service that is improved with user data is Google’s query autocompletion service. Google stores the queries of all its users to predict what you search for. Autocompletions are an effective feature. They help users to formulate better queries, and they save users keystrokes: Very helpful if you are searching on your mobile phone. The image below shows autocompletions for the prefix “surveillance”. The main reason for collecting user data is, of course, to show targeted advertisements. Why are targeted advertisements so profitable? This vintage news paper advertisement for a pain killer is only effective to people that are in pain. In the old days, the only way to target such an advertisement, was to choose a news paper that is read more by people in pain, and target pages in the news paper that are read most by the same people, for instance the health pages . Today, Facebook and Google will be able to find the individuals among their users that are likely in pain, and show the advertisement only to them. This makes targeted advertisements much more profitable Companies like Facebook and Google would like you to think that they must collect data to improve services and show targeted advertisements. We work at Searsia to debunk this. Let’s have a closer look at query autocompletions. Using user data to predict query autocompletions causes several problems. For instance, Google actively promoted nazi propaganda for innocent queries like “did the h”, and even worse, the first results for those queries would be pages from neo-nazi sites like Stormfront that deny that the holocaust happened. Many small organizations and individuals were damaged by autocompletions. There have been lawsuits in France , Italy , Germany , and Japan , where individuals could for instance not get a job because Google suggested offensive completions for their name. Google started to actively filter completions for person names after these lawsuits, but its autocompletions continue to suggested terms which could be viewed as racist, sexist or homophobic . At Searsia, we do not track user queries for autocompletions. Instead, we use the anchor texts of web pages, that is, the text of hyperlinks. We compared its performance with autocompletions based on user queries for a general web search task. Our approach that uses hyperlinks is as effective as the approach that uses user data. The results below show that for short queries, we need 1 more keystroke to predict the full user query. For long queries, our approach outperforms the approach based on user data. Now, you might think: Sure, you can improve services without tracking people, but..."

      "description": "We will start by adding the main engine by making a file index.json . The minimum information needed to add a search engine are: The engine's definition (called \"resource\" ), which needs the engine's identifier ( \"id\" ) that should match the file name, hence: \"index\" (excluding the file name extension). The Searsia version number ( \"searsia\" ), which will be v1.0.0 . An API template ( \"apitemplate\" ) for getting the search results, or alternatively, the search results themselves, called \"hits\" . In this case, we add three hits containing each only an engine identifier (called \"rid\" for \"resource identifier\"): \"engine1\" , \"engine2\" , and \"engine3\" The file index.json contains: { \"resource\": { \"id\": \"index\", \"name\": \"My Engine\" }, \"searsia\": \"v1.0.0\", \"hits\": [ { \"rid\": \"engine1\" }, { \"rid\": \"engine2\" }, { \"rid\": \"engine3\" } ] } We can test our engine definition index.json as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m index.json -t json which gives the following output: Searsia server v1.0.2 Testing: index (My Engine) {\"hits\": [ {\"rid\": \"engine1\"}, {\"rid\": \"engine2\"}, {\"rid\": \"engine3\"} ]} Warning: less than 10 results for query: searsia; see \"testquery\" or \"rerank\".

      "description": "Searsia can provide search results by scraping the HTML that search engines return for their end users. To add an HTML resource, use text\/html in the field \"mimetype\" . As the field \"apitemplate\" , take the resource's URL from your browser after querying the search engine, replacing the query in the url by {searchTerms} . If the URL does not contain a query, the search engine probably uses a POST request . To find out what the POST request is, we recommend Live HTTP Headers for Firefox. Put the POST string, replacing the query by {searchTerms} in the field \"post\" . For a JSON post request, additionally use \"postencode\" : \"application\/json\" Searsia uses XPath 1.0 to extract the search results from the web page. XPath is a query language for selecting elements of semi-structured data. Suppose the search results are displayed as list elements on the page, then these are encode as <li> ... <\/li> on the page, and they can be extracted from the page with the XPath query \/\/li . To find the most likely XPath query, we recommend Search Result Finder for Firefox. Fill in the XPath query in the field \"itempath\" . To tell Searsia how to extract the components of the search result, add \"extractors\" for the fields title , description , link , or any other field you like (the client also supports image ). We recommend to incrementally define your HTML search engine by first adding a random \"itempath\" XPath query, for instance \/\/foobar . Add a test query \"testquery\" for which you are sure the search engine gives at least 10 results. First attempt to incrementally define engine2.json : { \"resource\": { \"id\": \"engine2\", \"name\": \"Djoerd's Page\", \"apitemplate\": \"http:\/\/wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl\/~hiemstra\/?s={searchTerms}\", \"mimetype\": \"text\/html\", \"testquery\": \"federated\", \"itempath\": \"\/\/foobar\" }, \"searsia\": \"v1.0.0\", } Then test engine2.json with -t xml as follows. (This first attempt will not work, because the \"itempath\" is not yet correct, and the \"extractors\" that select the title, description and URL are still missing.) java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m engine2.json -t xml Tip: nicely format the XML with a tool like xmllint . Because the API template and mimetype are correct, this test outputs the HTML search result page converted to XML. We can now see that the search results on this page are using <h3> header tags. These header tags contain the search title (XPath extractor: . ), it contains the URL in the <a> anchor tag's href attribute (XPath extractor: .\/a\/@href ), and the first text node that follows is the description (XPath extractor: .\/following-sibling::text()[1] ). After editing, the file engine2.json contains: { \"resource\": { \"id\": \"engine2\", \"name\": \"Djoerd's Page\", \"apitemplate\": \"http:\/\/wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl\/~hiemstra\/?s={searchTerms}\", \"mimetype\": \"text\/html\", \"testquery\": \"federated\", \"itempath\": \"\/\/h3\", \"extractors\": { \"title\": \".\", \"url\": \".\/a\/@href\", \"description\": \".\/following-sibling::text()[1]\" } }, \"searsia\": \"v1.0.0\", } Testing the engine with JSON output gives the following result: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m engine2.json -t json Searsia server v1.0.2 Warning: Mother changed to http:\/\/wwwhome.cs.utwente.nl\/~hiemstra\/?s={searchTerms} Testing: engine2 (Djoerd's Page) { \"hits\": [   {    \"title\": \"Federated Search for Sheet Music\",    \"description\": \"Dr. Sheet Music is a federated search engine for sheet music.\",    \"url\": \"http:\/\/www.cs.utwente.nl\/~hiemstra\/2017\/federated-search-for-sheet-music.html\"   }, (...) ]} Test succeeded."

The following example selects only the hits from a JSON search engine (Actually, a search engine that produces Searsia's JSON) that have a URL.

      "url": "http:\/\/searsia.org\/protocol.html#examples",
      "description": "Searsia supports many API's by including API keys as secret parameters that will not be shared, as well as the possibility to add custom HTTP headers . Look at the API of UT Search at University of Twente Searsia API for examples of Searsia's resource configurations, including several examples that use HTML scrapers, and examples for accessing the API's of Google, Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, and more. If you believe that Searsia is unable to get search results from an existing resource that should be supported, please post your question under Searsia Server Issues . Please, note that Searsia is not meant to scrape sites that do not want to be scraped, and therefore does not contain ways to circumvent for instance session cookies. While the Searsia resource configurations provide a way to get the search results for a great variety of existing search engines, Searsia also provides a flexible way to structure the search results from these engines. The search results, i.e., the objects in the \"hits\" list, may contain any attribute that seems appropriate, for instance an attribute \"phone_number\" for a telephone directory or an attribute \"nr_of_citations\" for a search engine that searches scientific papers. The following attributed are reserved: \"title\" : The title of the search results, that can be clicked to go to the web page that was found. Usually, the title is equals to the title of the web page that was found. The title is the only attribute that is mandatory. \"url\" : The link to the web page that was found. \"description\" : A small summary describing the result. This might be a snippet from the web site containing the query, or some other summary. \"image\" : The url of a (thumbnail) image, to be displayed with the search result. The Results demo mockup below shows 7 ways to present the search results from Wikipedia's search suggestions , that is the mockup shows the same search results 7 times using different configurations. The 7 results presentations are achieved as follows: wikididyoumean , which' name is \"Did you mean:\" , returns a single search result, that contains the title as well as \"tags\":\"#suggestion\" , which tells the client to display the result as a query suggestion. wikifull ( Wikipedia Pages ) returns title, description and URL. In this configuration, the domain of \"urltemplate\" (wikipedia.net) does not match the results' domains (wikipedia.org). Therefore, the client displays the URLs for each aggregated result. The \"urltemplate\" is the url that the user will use to search on the site, whereas the \"apitemplate\" will be used by the server. wikiimage ( Wikipedia Images ) returns title and image and \"tags\":\"#image\" , which tells the client to display the results as an image result. Note how the XPath functions concat() and substring-after() are used to create a custom image URL. wikismall2 , which is called Search Wikipedia for , does not return URLs, which makes the client infer the URL from the \"title\" and the \"urltemplate\" , effectively creating a search engine that spawns a search on Wikipedia. wikifull2 ( Wikipedia Again ) returns full search results with a thumbnail image, much like the Wikipedia Pages engine above. wikismall ( Wikipedia Small ) returns search results with \"tags\":\"#small\" , telling the client to display the results on a single line. wikirelated is called Related searches: ; It returns only the titles and \"tags\":\"#small\" . The header Related searches: cannot be clicked because the resource does not configure the \"urltemplate\" for the end user. Note that each configuration uses the same \"apitemplate\" : Each of the 7 results effectively use the exact same search engine. Please do not use this example in a actual server configuration. Note that the configuration of the mockup, if used in an actual Searsia Server, would send each query 7 times(!) to Wikipedia."

      "description": "Searsia manages large collections of independent sources. Many advanced features of search engines might be seen as sources too, such as query autocompletion, related queries, and spelling correction, that is, these features are provided by modules that receive the query, and return a recommendation. Query autocompletion provides users with suggested queries in a drop down box as they type their query. Related queries are given on the search page to direct users to alternative formulations of their query, or to otherwise related information. Spelling correction suggests corrected queries if the user types an incorrectly spelled query, or an otherwise unusual query. Corrections are either used directly or presented to the user as alternatives (“Did you mean: …”). There are two main approaches to recommendations, often used in for instance movie recommender systems: 1) collaborative filtering provides recommendations based on actions from similar users (as in Amazon: “Customers who bought this item also bought…”); and 2) content-based filtering provides recommendations based on the similarity between items. Autocompletions and related queries in search engines are almost always based on queries from other users, i.e., they are essentially collaborative filtering approaches. Besides the fact that it might be undesirable to log the actions of the users, there are also other drawbacks: First, there is a cold-start problem: How to implement recommendations for a new system (when there are no user actions yet), or for a system that does not have a lot of users? Second, user queries might be stupid, racist, or otherwise objectionable: How to prevent recommending those? (it is not hard to find examples on-line of search engine autocomplete fails, as well as law suits about objectionable recommendations). We will implement and demonstrate open source solutions for recommended queries that use content-based filtering, for instance based on a web crawl, or directly based on the Searsia sample index (The Searsia server indexes search results for each resource to learn what information each resource provides). Our recommendations work without user tracking."

      "description": "Advertisements are the main source of income for many web sites and search engines. To make Searsia an interesting solution for developers of web search applications, we want to provide them the means to easily and transparantly add advertisements as an independent source to Searsia. The advertisements must be recognisable as advertisements, they should not track the users of the search service, and it should be easy to switch them off. Advertisements in search engines are much more effective than advertisements on ordinary web sites, because users tell the search engine exactly what they are currently looking for: The user’s query is the ideal signal for an advertisement network. We believe user tracking is not desirable and not needed for good advertisements in search applications. Searsia technology should (also) work without user tracking. Searsia uses a broker (the Searsia server) that acts as an intermediary between the sources and the user. We will implement advertisement such that the user’s queries will not go directly to the advertisement network. Instead, they are forwarded by the broker. So, the advertisement network will not receive information that might identify the user, such as IP numbers, cookies, and the browser’s user agent string, which makes it virtually impossible to identify or track the user. We will find at least one, and likely more advertisement partners that share our vision, and that are willing to provide advertisements for anonymous queries from Searsia search engines."

In 2014, Robert Epstein and Ronald Robertson of the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology in the US conducted the following experiment: They asked people what candidate they would support in the Australian election, Tony Abbott or Julia Gillard? Then they let them search information about the candidates. However, the researchers did not tell the people that they manipulated the search results. People used a search engine for which higher-ranked search results linked to Web pages that describe one candidate as the better than the other. Their paper shows the results of two search engines: one that is biased to Gillard and one that is biased to Abbot. In all cases, people changed their minds towards the biased search engine’s results much and much more often than you would expect if people change their minds at random. The study shows that people have a great trust in search engines. If results are willingly manipulated, search engines could easily swing an election. The researchers call this the Search Engine Manipulation Effect ."

      "description": "The second thing that worries me: Search engines receive information from us that is really, really private. We search things about our health, about our sexual preferences, about our financial situation. Most search engines log our queries, and they hold on to that information, indefinitely. They also log our clicks. And they use this information to target us with advertisements. Sadly, the most vulnerable people in our society, people with bad health or with bad credit scores, are in practice targeted the most. It is worth reading Cathy O’Neil’s analogy between optimizing advertisement returns and the “itinerant quack” in an old western ( O’Neil 2016 ): Vulnerability is worth gold. It always has been. Picture an itinerant quack in an old western movie. He pulls into town with his wagon full of jangling jars and bottles. When he sits down with an elderly prospective customer, he seeks out her weaknesses. She covers her mouth when she smiles, indicating that she’s sensitive about her bad teeth. She anxiously twirls her old wedding ring, which from the looks of her swollen knuckle will be stuck there till the end of her days. Arthritis. So when he pitches his products to her, he focuses on the ugliness of her teeth and her aching hands. He can promise to restore the beauty of her smile and wash away the pain from her joints. With this knowledge, he knows he’s halfway to a sale before even clearing his throat to speak."

      "description": "Searsia’s approach to search can ease some of these worries. Searsia is a federated search engine. A Searsia search engine is a federation of search engines, like the European Union (EU) is a federation of countries. Within the EU, each countries has its own government and its own laws. Within Searsia, each search engine indexes whatever it likes and returns whatever it likes. Sites like Wikipedia, Amazon, Stack Overflow and YouTube provide their own search interface. Obviously, they do not need to crawl their site, because they own the data. They instantly know when something changed. Searsia comes with a configuration mechanism that makes it easy to add search engines to the federation. When a Searsia engine receives a query, it forwards the query to a selection of the search engines in the federation. It will try to select those search engines that most likely satisfy the user’s need, for instance forwarding a query to YouTube, if it believes the user would like a video. This way, Searsia displays live results from YouTube, instead of results that were crawled a while ago. Each Searsia engine is a search engine too, pretty much like any other search engine, so we might make a federation of those search engines again."

      "description": "Let’s go back to our three worries: Manipulation, Privacy, and Costs of crawling. What do you gain by installing Searsia? First, Searsia delegates queries to multiple search engines that it does not control. Even if one or two of those manipulate or censor their results, there will be other engines in the federation that show more objective results. Second, all queries go via Searsia, so engines in the federation can no longer track individual users. Of course, now Searsia will get all your queries, but no worries, anyone can run a Searsia server. Third, Searsia does not crawl the web, ever. It will learn over time from each engine in the federation what its contents are. This makes it cheap to set up a Searsia engine, and easy to maintain. You can run Searsia on a cheap server in your own network."

      "description": "At the ISOC meeting, someone in the audience asked me the following: Does Searsia show the advertisements of a search engine? If not then search engines will likely object to being part of a Searsia federation. Searsia will generally be configured to access the official APIs of search engines from Google, Twitter, etc., and it will show whatever the engine’s official API returns. For our current demonstration deployment, U. Twente Search , we have not seen any of the APIs returning advertisements. However, Searsia’s configuration options are quite general; they include options for scraping web results, and for selecting (and ignoring) returned elements, including advertisements. So, yes, Searsia can be configured such that it ignores advertisements from engines. The Searsia client explicitly shows what engine in the federation produced the results. This way, Searsia transparently creates traffic for search engines and for the sites they search. Searsia announces itself by a custom User-Agent string . If sites object to being part of Searsia, they can be removed from the federation.

      "description": "Query autocompletion based on actual user queries may return offensive results. In 2010, a French appeals court ordered Google to remove the word arnaque, which translates roughly as “scam”, from appearing in Google’s autocompletions for CNFDI, the Centre National Privé de Formation a Distance (McGee 2010) . Google’s defense argued that its tool is based on an algorithm applied to actual search queries: It was users that searched for “cnfdi arnaque” that caused the algorithm to select offensive suggestions. The court however ruled that Google is responsible for the suggestions that it generates. Google lost a similar lawsuit in Italy, where queries for an unnamed plaintiff’s name were presented with autocomplete suggestions including truffatore (“con man”) and truffa (“fraud”) (Meyer 2011) . In another similar law suite, German’s former first lady Bettina Wulff” sued Google for defamation when queries for her name completed with terms like “escort” and “prostitute” (Lardinois 2012) . In yet another lawsuit in Japan, Google was ordered to disable autocomplete results for an unidentified man who could not find a job because a search for his name linked him with crimes he was not involved with (BBC 2012) . Google has since updated its autocompletion results by filtering offensive completions for person names, no matter who the person is (Yehoshua 2016) . But controversies over query autocompletions remain. A study by Baker and Potts (2013) highlights that autocompletions produce suggested terms which can be viewed as racist, sexist or homophobic. Baker and Pots analyzed the results of over 2,500 query prefixes and concluded that completion algorithms inadvertently help to perpetuate negative stereotypes of certain identity groups. There is increasing evidence that autocompletions play an important role in spreading fake news and propaganda. Query suggestions actively direct users to fake content on the web, even when they are not looking for it (Roberts 2016) . Examples include bizarre completions for – again – person names, like “Michelle Obama is a man”, but also completions like “Did the holocaust happen”, which if selected, returns as its top result a link to the neo-Nazi site stormfront.org (Cadwalladr 2016) . The examples show that query autocompletions can be harmful when they are based on searches by previous users. Harmful completions are suggested when ordinary users seek to expose or confirm rumors and conspiracy theories. Furthermore, there are indications that harmful query suggestions increasingly result from computational propaganda, i.e., organizations use bots to game search engines and social networks (Shorey and Howard 2016) ."

      "description": "Morally unacceptable query completions are not only introduced by the searches of previous users, they are also mutually reinforced by the search engine and its users. When a query autocompletion algorithm suggests morally unacceptable queries, users are likely to select those, even if the users are only confused or stunned by the suggestion. But how does the search engine ever learn it was wrong? It might not ever. As soon as the system determined that some queries are recommended; they are more often selected by users, which in turn makes the queries end up in the training data that the search engine uses to train it’s future query autocompletion algorithms. Such a destructive feedback loop is one of the features of a Weapon of Math Destruction, a term coined by O’Neil (2016) to describe harmful statistical models. O’Neil sums up three elements of a Weapon of Math Destruction: Damage, Opacity, and Scale. Indeed, the damage caused by query autocompletion algorithms is extensively discussed in the previous section. Query autocompletion algorithms are opaque since they are based on the proprietary, previous searches known only by the search engine. If run by a search engine that has a big market share, the query completion algorithm also scales to a large number of users. Query autocompletions of a search engine with a majority market share in a country might substantially alter the opinion of the country’s citizens, for instance, a substantial number of people will start to doubt whether the holocaust really happened."

      "description": "It is instructive to view a query autocompletion algorithm as a recommender system, that is, the search engine recommends queries based on some input. Recommender systems are usually classified into two categories based on how recommendations are made: 1) Collaborative recommendations, and 2) Content-based recommendations (Adomavicius and Tuzhilin 2005) . Collaborative query autocompletions are based on similarities between users: “People that typed this prefix often searched for: …”. Content-based query autocompletions are based on similarities with the content: “Web pages that contain this prefix are often about: …”. Until now, we only discussed collaborative query autocompletion algorithms. What would a content-based query autocompletion algorithm look like? Bhatia et al. (2011) proposed a system that generates autocompletions by using all N-grams of order 1, 2 and 3 (that is single words, word pairs, and word triples) from the documents. They tested their content-based autocompletions on newspaper data and on data from ubuntuforums.org. Instead of N-gram models from all text, Kraft and Zien (2004) built models for query reformulation solely from the anchor text, the clickable text from hyperlinks in web pages. Interestingly, Dang and Croft (2010) argue that anchor text can be an effective substitute for query logs. They studied the use of anchor texts for a range of query reformulation techniques, including query-based stemming and query reformulation, treating the anchor text as if it were a query log. At Searsia, we develop open source tools that allow search engine developers to easily develop content-based autocompletions, so autocompletions without the need to track users. A first demo of content-based autocompletions using anchor texts now runs on: U. Twente Search . In the coming weeks, we will evaluate our content-based recommendations for U. Twente search, and we will investigate whether content-based autocompletions can replace collaborative autocompletions on web scale. The first results look promising: We believe content-based recommendations can provide high quality query autocompletions, and fix some of the harmful effects of today’s query autocompletion algorithms."

If you have a query log for your search engine, then you can effectively use them in searsiasuggest . However, there are many downsides to using query logs. We talked about some of these in last month’s blog post Query autocompletions considered harmful : Query suggestions that use query logs may return offensive and damaging results, and they suffer from a destructive feedback loop, where bad suggestions are mutually reinforced by the search engine and its users.

      "description": "Are query suggestions from anchor text any good compared to query suggestions from query logs? To check this, we used the query log of Greg Pass, Abdur Chowdhury, and Cayley Torgeson , which contains 20 million queries submitted by about 650,000 users to the AOL search engine between March and May in 2006. Following the recent query autocompletion experiments by Fei Cai, Shangsong Liang, and Maarten de Rijke , we used queries submitted before 8 May 2006 as train queries and queries submitted afterwards as test queries. We removed queries containing URL substrings ( http: , https: , www. , .com , .net , .org , and .edu ) from both training and test queries. We did not further filter the data ( Fei Cai et al. only kept queries appearing in both partitions). Because we are not interested in personalization, we put 99% of the users in the training data, and the remaining 1% of the users in the test data. This leaves more than 3.3 million unique training queries for searsiasuggest and 952 queries for testing the system. For every test query, we used 10 different prefixes as input to searsiasuggest : 1 to 5 characters, and 1 to 5 words. If the query has less than 5 characters or less than 5 words, we take the full query as input. For each prefix we measured the mean reciprocal rank of the position for which searsiasuggest returns the full test query. The mean reciprocal rank is calculated as one divided by the position of the correct results, so it will be 1 if the correct result is returned first, 0.5 if it is returned second, etc. We also measured the average number of results returned for each prefix.

After typing 1 word, the MRR is 0.271, i.e., on average the correct suggestion is available in the top 4 results. The script evaluate.py is provided to compute the evaluation retults. For anchor text completions we ideally would need a large web crawl from 2006 (the year of the query log). In absence of such a crawl, we used data from ClueWeb09 , a web crawl of more than 1 billion pages crawled in January and February 2009 by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. Anchor texts for the English pages in this collection (about 0.5 billion pages) are readily available, so we do not actually need to process the ClueWeb09 web pages themselves. Anchor texts with the separators ( . , ? , ! , | , - or ; ) followed by a space were split in multiple strings. Text in braces () , {} , [] was removed from the strings. We processed the anchor texts by retaining only suggestions that occur at least 15 times. This resulted in 46 million unique suggestions. Performance of the ClueWeb09 anchor text suggestions is presented in Table 2. Table 2, Quality of query autocompletions using anchor texts Prefix MRR Returned 1 char 0.006 10.00 2 char 0.025 10.00 3 char 0.066 10.00 4 char 0.123 9.92 5 char 0.180 9.71 1 word 0.251 8.62 2 word 0.415 5.42 3 word 0.440 3.95 4 word 0.443 3.67 5 word 0.443 3.64 The results show that for queries of 2 words or more (the average query length in the test data is 2.6), anchor text autocompletions perform better than query log autocompletions, up till an MRR of 0.443 (0.366 for query logs). Query log autocompletions perform better for shorter queries: Anchor text autocompletions need about one character more than query log autocompletions to achieve a similar MRR for the first 5 characters."

For queries of more than 1 word, they outperform autocompletions that are based on over two months of query log data. Simply extracting all anchor texts is really only a first attempt to get well-performing autocompletions from web content. Ideas to improve suggestions are: Using linguistic knowledge to get suggestions from all web page text (for instance using the Stanford CoreNLP tools ), using web knowledge like PageRank scores and Spam scores to improve the quality of suggestions, and reranking of suggestions by their “query-ness” using machine learning. But for now, please enjoy the query suggestions from searsiasuggest ."

      "description": "Search engines use inverted files to quickly search in lots of documents. An inverted file operates much like the index in the back of a book that lists for each important term the pages that describe the term. Similarly, an inverted file lists for every word the web pages that contain the word. This allows a search engine to quickly select the pages for your query. A full-fledged inverted file search engine for the browser is provided by Sphinx , the Python Documentation Generator. While generating the documentation, Sphinx also generates a JavaScript file called searchindex.js which contains the inverted file. Before searching the documentation, the file is downloaded to the browser to provide search results in only milliseconds. A similar approach is taken by Lunr.js . Lunr is completely written in JavaScript. It provides indexing functionality, a powerful query language, and it runs both in the browser as server-side with node.js. Lunr’s standard mode of operation builds the entire index in the browser, but it also offers a way for downloading pre-built indexes similar to Sphinx. Another remarkable example of an inverted file search engine for the browser is JScene , a proof-of-concept search engine developed by Jimmy Lin. Lin (2015) pushed JScene to its limits by searching 1.1 million tweets in milliseconds on a Mac-book Pro (containing an i7 processor and 16 GB of RAM). Although awesome from a technical perspective, searching that many documents is not yet practical. JScene took more than 10 hours to create a massive 1.8 gigabyte index from 140 megabytes of tweets. The pre-built index would need to be downloaded to the browser before the querying can start (and most certainly would crash our crappy smart phone). So, while searching millions of pages might not be practical yet in the web browser, searching less than a few thousand pages certainly is. This is useful for the many smaller web sites that are out there: personal blogs, sites with software documentation, sites of small and medium-sized enterprises, and yes, the great Cranfield collection."

      "description": "Searsia is all about delegating search to other search engines. So why would Searsia support in-browser search? The reason is that in practice, the search quality of some engines in a federated search engine might not be that good. In such cases, Searsia provides the possibility to add the “rerank” attribute to a search engine definition, indicating that Searsia should rerank the results returned by the search engine. This works particularly well if the low-quality search engine provides a large result set, for instance the top 500 most recent news events. Reranking might be done server-side (by searsiaserver ) or in the browser (by searsiaclient ). In both cases, building an inverted index is useless, because the low quality search engine might provide different low quality results for each query. Instead, Searsia simply scans over each result to output a reranked top X of high quality search results to the user. Constructing the inverted file would be much more costly: In addition to scanning each document it has to do a complete sort of all term-document pairs. As an interesting side-effect of Searsia’s in-browser linear search approach, users can create a static Searsia search result file, like a “search engine” that always gives the same search results. Obviously, the quality of search engines get not much lower than that. However, if we now define a search engine with the rerank attribute that always takes the static results, then the resulting search engine is pretty good, especially if all pages are included in the static search results. This is how to make the Cranfield search demo: The search engine definition and search results are defined in a single configuration file cran.json ."

If search happens inside your browser, then your query does not need to leave your private machine, ever. This way, the site owner cannot learn what you searched for, and you can safely search for private information concerning for instance your health, sexual preferences, or financial situation. Private search using Searsia is demonstrated by NLnet Search . Here, the client uses URL fragments (the part after the hash symbol # ) to encode the queries. That part of the URL is not send to the web server, so NLnet will not find out what you search for. To experience private search, do a single search on NLnet, and then turn off the wifi on your phone or laptop: Searching should still work without an internet connection. Of course, once you click on a search result, the site will get some indication of what you searched for, but at least your queries are not leaked to the site owners. No chance they end up in some autocompletion feature ."

Please note, Searsia’s in-browser search is still experimental and largely undocumented. The implementation in the v1 branch on Github is much better than the master branch, and it will be further improved in the near future. We will provide more guidelines and documentation once we release version 1.0.0 of Searsia. In the meantime, contact us if you need help trying out Searsia’s in-browser search."

Such platforms, often called ad exchanges , serve multiple ad networks. Platforms are increasingly specializing towards either buying ad space or selling ad space, in which case they are called demand-side platforms or supply-side platforms . Platforms determine the prices of the advertisement space through bidding : Advertisers bid on advertisement space by deciding what they are willing to pay for each impression of their ad or for each click on their ad."

Real-time bidding sounds fascinating, but it is really a search: The platform searches the best advertisement based on various pieces of data, such as the user’s demographic information, browsing history, and location. The more accurate the behavioral targeting of users, the more the advertisement network earns. That’s why networks track users online. They profile users by “following” them around to gather as much data on users as possible. This way, when a user reads an article on a publisher’s web site, say a real publisher like a newspaper, the advertisement network can guess what advertisement the user is willing to click, and ultimately what product a user is willing to buy."

DuckDuckGo describes this aptly on the DuckDuckGo company pages : It is a myth that search engines need to track you to make money on Web search. When you type in a search, we can show an ad just based on that search term. For example, if you type in, “car” we show a car ad.

Many advertisement platforms support OpenRTB, usually version 2.3, which is currently the most widely adopted release.

      "description": "One of the biggest changes in OpenRTB version 2.3 compared to previous versions is the support for native advertising. Native advertising provides ads that match the form and function of the site on which they appear. One of the main examples of native ads are search ads : ads that appear within search result pages. The difference between native ads and traditional display ads comes down to metadata. Display ads, such as the traditional banner ad, need only an image of predefined size. Native ads however, provide several separate pieces of information like a title, a summary, a thumbnail image, and the brand’s logo. This way, its appearance can be tailored to a publisher’s content feed or a search engine’s result page. Of course, advertisements should always be clearly marked such that they are recognized as paid content by the users. OpenRTB comes with a separate specification for native ads, OpenRTB Native 1.2 , which contains a detailed explanation of the sub-protocol of the OpenRTB real-time bidding interface for native ads."

Furthermore, real-time bidding for a search site is more easy than real-time bidding for many other sites, because the advertisement network can show an ad based on the user’s search query, without the need to track the user. Finally, there is an open standard for real-time bidding, fittingly called OpenRTB, that is used by many advertising networks and that includes a detailed subprotocol for native search ads.

Leakage of the user’s search terms may occur because of the HTTP referrer header. Browsers that run the Searsia client will send this referrer header — possibly including the query — to the site that the user wants to visit. Leakage of the user’s search terms might be the biggest threat to privacy in this list, because users share intimate details with search engines.

Most on-line advertisement networks will instruct publishers that want to display advertisements to include Javascript in their page or they instruct publishers to load an external Javascript file (or both). Obviously in such cases, not only downloading the Javascript file leaks privacy information, but it additionally runs third-party code in the user’s browser to further monitor the user’s behaviour. For instance, advertising networks use web beacons to check if the advertisement is viewable or mouse Tracking to check if they are hovered or clicked. As an example of the requirements of advertisement networks, Yahoo’s Native ads for the web shows the kind of code that has to be included in a web site to allow Yahoo displaying advertisements.

This can be changed to for instance 'origin' to send only the first part of the URL without the query string. Leakage via advertisements, finally, cannot be prevented easily, unless the advertisement networks allow the Searsia server to anonymize all the user interactions with the advertisements.

Running an affiliate program is often as easy as putting a hyperlink to a merchant’s product on your site that contains your affiliate identifier.

The examples use: 1) affiliate programs of multinational corporations like Amazon, 2) affiliate networks like ShareASale, and 3) any other information that we would like to advertise. Our configuration files are based on Searsia Server version 1.0 , which is not released yet, but already available on Github. The affiliate programs described here are demonstrated by Dr. Sheet Music , a federated search engine for sheet music. Affiliate programs: Amazon and eBay Many large sites run their own affiliate programs. Let’s have a look at two of the biggest players in affiliate land: Amazon and eBay. Amazon Affiliate Program Amazon’s affiliate program can be joined for free. Publishers earn up to 10% advertising fees with Amazon and its trusted merchants. Like many of the bigger affiliate programs, Amazon provides an Product Advertising API that can be found under “Tools” once you are logged in. The API can be configured as a Searsia engine with the following configuration file (which runs on-line here ). { \"resource\" : { \"id\" : \"amazon\" , \"name\" : \"Amazon\" , \"favicon\" : \"https:\/\/amazon.com\/favicon.ico\" , \"apitemplate\" : \"http:\/\/webservices.amazon.com\/onca\/xml?Service=AWSECommerceService&Operation=ItemSearch&AWSAccessKeyId={accesskey}&AssociateTag={associateid}&SearchIndex=Music&Keywords={q}\" , \"testquery\" : \"verdi\" , \"mimetype\" : \"application\/xml\" , \"signature\" : \"HmacSHA256({secretkey})\" , \"itempath\" : \"\/\/Items\/Item\" , \"extractors\" : { \"title\" : \".\/ItemAttributes\/Title\" , \"description\" : \".\/ItemAttributes\/Artist|.\/ItemAttributes\/Manufacturer|.\/ItemAttributes\/Creator\" , \"tags\" : \"'advertisement'\" , \"url\" : \".\/DetailPageURL\" }, \"privateparameters\" : { \"associateid\" : \"VALUE MISSING\" , \"accesskey\" : \"VALUE MISSING\" , \"secretkey\" : \"VALUE MISSING\" } }, \"searsia\" : \"v1.0.0\" } To use this configuration file, get your Associate Id, Access Key and Secret Key from Amazon’s affiliate program and fill them in under \"privateparameters\" . The \"apitemplate\" contains the URL parameter SearchIndex=Music to restrict the search to include only products in Amazon’s Music category. One of the keys of \"extractors\" is \"tags\" with as its value \"'advertisement'\" (the value needs to be an XPath query, hence the single quote to denote the result is a constant string): This will add the key value pair \"tags\": \"advertisement\" to the search output, which is used by the Searsia Client to show advertisements differently from ordinary search results. Most of the attributes of this configuration file are also supported by Searsia Server version 0.4 , except \"signature\" , which signs the API request with the Secret Key using a HMAC-SHA256 signature as required by Amazon. Testing a Searsia engine in SearsiaServer version 1 is easy and can be done as follows: java -jar searsiaserver.jar -m amazon.json -t json eBay Partner Network Another big online ecommerce site, eBay, offers an affiliate program called the eBay Partner Network . Like Amazon, eBay also offers a Shopping Services API . The API can be configured as a Searsia engine with the following configuration file (which runs on-line here ). { \"resource\" : { \"id\" : \"ebay\" , \"name\" : \"eBay\" , \"favicon\" : \"https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/favicon.ico\" , \"apitemplate\" : \"http:\/\/svcs.ebay.com\/services\/search\/FindingService\/v1?OPERATION-NAME=findItemsAdvanced&SERVICE-VERSION=1.0.0&SECURITY-APPNAME={appId}&RESPONSE-DATA-FORMAT=XML&REST-PAYLOAD&keywords={q}&categoryId=180015&descriptionSearch=true&affiliate.trackingId={affiliateId}&affiliate.networkId=9\" , \"testquery\" : \"mozart\" , \"itempath\" : \"\/\/item\" , \"extractors\" : { \"title\" : \".\/title\" , \"image\" : \".\/galleryURL\" , \"description\" : \".\/\/categoryName|.\/\/conditionDisplayName|.\/\/currentPrice\/@currencyId|.\/\/currentPrice\" , \"price\" : \"concat(string(.\/\/currentPrice\/@currencyId),' ',string(.\/\/currentPrice))\" , \"url\" : \".\/viewItemURL\"..."

      "description": "In surveillance capitalism , companies compete by collecting as much data as possible through surveillance. They sell that data, or they use the data to predict who is most likely to buy a product or service. Why do companies use surveillance? They will (have to) explain this in their terms-of-service: You know, the lengthy disclaimer that you accepted without reading. Typically, the terms-of-service of companies like Google and Facebook claim that collecting user data is necessary for at least two reasons: 1) to improve the service and 2) to show targeted advertisements ."

      "description": "An example of a search service that is improved with user data is Google’s query autocompletion service. Google stores the queries of all its users to predict what you search for. Autocompletions are an effective feature. They help users to formulate better queries, and they save users keystrokes: Very helpful if you are searching on your mobile phone. The image below shows autocompletions for the prefix “surveillance”."

      "description": "The main reason for collecting user data is, of course, to show targeted advertisements. Why are targeted advertisements so profitable? This vintage news paper advertisement for a pain killer is only effective to people that are in pain. In the old days, the only way to target such an advertisement, was to choose a news paper that is read more by people in pain, and target pages in the news paper that are read most by the same people, for instance the health pages . Today, Facebook and Google will be able to find the individuals among their users that are likely in pain, and show the advertisement only to them. This makes targeted advertisements much more profitable Companies like Facebook and Google would like you to think that they must collect data to improve services and show targeted advertisements. We work at Searsia to debunk this."

      "description": "Let’s have a closer look at query autocompletions. Using user data to predict query autocompletions causes several problems. For instance, Google actively promoted nazi propaganda for innocent queries like “did the h”, and even worse, the first results for those queries would be pages from neo-nazi sites like Stormfront that deny that the holocaust happened. Many small organizations and individuals were damaged by autocompletions. There have been lawsuits in France , Italy , Germany , and Japan , where individuals could for instance not get a job because Google suggested offensive completions for their name. Google started to actively filter completions for person names after these lawsuits, but its autocompletions continue to suggested terms which could be viewed as racist, sexist or homophobic . At Searsia, we do not track user queries for autocompletions. Instead, we use the anchor texts of web pages, that is, the text of hyperlinks. We compared its performance with autocompletions based on user queries for a general web search task. Our approach that uses hyperlinks is as effective as the approach that uses user data. The results below show that for short queries, we need 1 more keystroke to predict the full user query. For long queries, our approach outperforms the approach based on user data."

      "description": "Now, you might think: Sure, you can improve services without tracking people, but it is impossible to target advertisements without tracking people. Not quite. Remember Searsia is a search engine. Users tell a search engine what they are looking for. If you are looking for a car, Searsia can show you advertisements for cars. The advertisements are based on the search terms, not on the person. Targeted advertisements by Searsia are based on the query, not on the person, so there is not need to track individual users. Images and banners are provided via a local proxy, so the merchant or advertisement network will not know the users’ IP address unless they click on the advertisement. Advertisements do not use third party Javascript, third party cookies, or web beacons to prevent further privacy leakage via advertisements . The requirements for Javascript and cookies above do not allow Searsia to display ads from for instance Google’s DoubleClick . However, they are perfect for displaying advertisements from affiliate programs and networks. Searsia connects big affiliate programs APIS of for instance Amazon . It provides local search from datafeeds of affiliate networks like ShareASale . The image above shows example advertisements provided by Dr. SheetMusic for the query amazon , which provides advertisements for charities if there are no targeted affiliate results."

      "description": "Searsia provides free open source software for federated search. Federated systems are the answer to global corporations like Twitter, Facebook and Google that profit from tracking their users. In a federated system, no-one owns the complete service, so no-one is able to profit from tracking all user interactions. The poem that started this post was taken from Mastodon , a federated alternative for Twitter and Facebook. Just as Mastodon is a federated alternative for Twitter, Searsia’s technology might one day be an alternative for Google. If that happens, we know that there is no reason to track users, not even for providing autocompletions or targeted advertisements."
